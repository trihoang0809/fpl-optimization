# fpl-project
My personal project that aims to help me have a successful Fantasy Premier League season :D

• Developed a recommendation system based on players’ current form
• Implemented the FPL APIs to enable real-time insights on top-performing players, teams, and transfer trends
• Built a notification system for timely lineup adjustments each week

I achieved a top 3% FPL global ranking last season. This season, I am currently ranked in the top 0.4%. Hopefully I can keep it up!
