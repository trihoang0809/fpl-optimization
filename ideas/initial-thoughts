FPL-related
Possible ideas:
- utilize point prediction to pick a player/substitution for each gameweek (pull data from a point prediction system)
- automate substituting players before the gameweek's deadline
- automate choosing a captain for each gameweek
- tracking players' expected and actual points
- putting players into watchlist



-->
functions to call from terminal:
- substitute("Gabriel Jesus", "Erling Haaland") 
- transfer("Gabriel Jesus", "Erling Haaland") // --> "transfer success/not enough money/no more free transfers, wanna continue (-4)?"
- suggestions("17", 5) --> 5 players to watch for for gameweek 17
--> a watchlist array to append/remove players I'm keeping an eye on
- top_forms(5) --> 5 players currently at the highest form
- captain("Mohamed Salah", "17") // --> set Salah as captain for GW17
- deadline("17") --> deadline to change team on GW17
(maybe automate substitution before the deadline)


Possible add-ons: injured list; players' form (average of last 5 GWs)

--> Tasks: see how to communicate with/use FPL APIs and websites with FPL data/point prediction system


Update: Sat, Aug 5:
Looks like you can't communicate with the website to automate substitution, setting captains, etc.
--> Possible features: get players on top forms, most-captained, most transferred-in, next gameweek's deadline, putting players into a watchlist,
suggesting players based on, players' current forms, etc.
