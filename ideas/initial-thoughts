Possible ideas:
- utilize point prediction to pick a player/substitution for each gameweek (pull data from a point prediction system)
- automate substituting players before the gameweek's deadline
- automate choosing a captain for each gameweek
- tracking players' expected and actual points
- putting players into watchlist
